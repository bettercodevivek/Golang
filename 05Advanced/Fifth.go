// LET US NOW STUDY ABOUT DEFER KEYWORD IN GOLANG

/*The defer keyword is used to postpone the execution of a function until the surrounding function returns. Itâ€™s often used for cleanup tasks,
like closing files or releasing resources, to ensure they are handled properly even if an error occurs in the function. */

package main

import "fmt"

func main() {

	defer fmt.Println("and this is the 1st defer statement")

	defer fmt.Println("this is the 2nd defer statement")

	defer fmt.Println("this is the 3nd defer statement")

	// it can be clearly seen that in case of multiple defer statements , the defer statements follow LIFO. therefore last statment will get executed first.

	fmt.Println("my name is vivek and i am learning golang !")

}
